test program: ```js meteo.mjs```

test tests: ```npm test```

change //const teisLatitud = 42.2576; / const teisLongitud = -8.683;// values according to the location you want open-meteo to check

if running ```npm test``` throws an error the first time (like this: ‚óè  Cannot log after tests are done. Did you forget to wait for something async in your test? Attempted to log "Velocidad del viento: 131Km/h".), try again and it will work
